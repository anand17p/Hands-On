        A marriage in our society is perceived as a mere ritual to bring two families together. I donâ€™t see it as a
        tradition that need to be followed just for the sake of it. You might not agree with the way I see this
        beautiful bond of two souls, but I think, the meaning of marriage is much bigger than our society tries to
        define.
